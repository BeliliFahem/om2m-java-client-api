For a Java developer, develop solutions based on "Open M2M" server while enjoying all its features and services, is another concern in addition to business concerns. It is from this realization that the need for an API to communicate with the server "Open M2M" by object was born.

OM2M provides an open source service platform for M2M interoperability based on the ETSI-M2M standard. OM2M follows a RESTful approach with open interfaces to enable developing services and applications independently of the underlying network. It proposes a modular architecture running on top of an OSGi layer, making it highly extensible via plugins. It supports multiple protocol bindings such as HTTP and CoAP. Various interworking proxies are provided to enable seamless communication with vendor-specific technologies such as Zigbee and Phidgets devices.
